# CultureProject
The two pictures named Chinese.png and White.png are supposed to be the main project and have more files within them.  I have also provided the all images I used within each image in case its hard to replicate the extraction process.

Some tools needed to look through this project:
stegsolve(https://wiki.bi0s.in/steganography/stegsolve/) to combine the images together
the command "binwalk -e -D "png images:png" to extract more images from within the Chinese.png and White.png files
