# CultureProject
The  pictures named Chinese.png, White.png, MomSpeaking.png, and DadSpeaking.png are supposed to be the main project and have more files within them.  I have also provided the all images and text I used within each image in case its hard to replicate the extraction process in the soruce file.<br /> <br />

Some tools needed to look through this project: <br />
The linux operating system makes it easier, but it is possible on windows <br />
[stegsolve](https://wiki.bi0s.in/steganography/stegsolve/) to combine the images together <br />
The command "binwalk -e -D "png images:png" to extract more images from within the Chinese.png and White.png files <br />
The command "binwalk -e " should be used to extract the text from the Mom and Dad Speaking images
